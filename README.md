## Vision Transformer Implementation

This is an Equinox (a JAX based framework) implementation of Vision Transformers made by following the example in official docs of Equinox. To run this locally, first clone the repo and then 

1. Install the requirements
2. Run `train.py`.

The Local execution might take some time depending on the size of the dataset (170 Mb for CIFAR-10) and GPU capabilities. Hence, a notebook is provided which can be directly run on google colab with v2-8 TPU. The results achieved in this setting under 30 mintues are showcases below.
